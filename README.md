# recursive-estimation-course-project

In the first task, an Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) is designed for tracking the position and orientation of a three-wheeled robot that is moving on a plane. The main code task was the estimator function.

In the second task, the task is to design a Particle Filter (PF) that tracks two cleaning robots A,B that are moving at speeds uA, uB > 0 and headings in a square room with side length L. When a robot reaches a wall, it bounces off at a random angle that depends on the incident angle. At various times, the four sensors S1, S2, S3, S4, which are installed in the corners of the room, provide distance measurements to the robots. The estimator function was programmed in this group project.

The project was a three-person group project, the code for both estimators was mainly created by me.
